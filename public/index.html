        Ross Ulbricht founded Silk Road, introduced thousands to crypto, and
        received a disproportionate prison sentence of two lifetimes plus 40
        years. Today we unite in solidarity for Ross, gathering funds to buy his
        “GENESIS COLLECTION” NFTs, and protesting the injustice of the US prison
        and justice systems.
      </p>
      <p>Stand against injustice and Free Ross. Contribute here:</p>

      <p id="contribution-info"><b>Only contributions in ETH on Ethereum mainnet will be eligible for the auction bid and subsequent pro-rata fraction distribution.</b> Do not send FreeRossDAO other assets. All other assets will be considered a donation to the DAO’s treasury—to be governed by FreeRossDAO—and are not eligible for pro-rata fractions. After the contribution period has been closed (block number to be announced), future ETH contributions sent in error up to 72 hours afterwards will be refunded in full, and are not eligible for pro-rata fractions.</p>

        <h2>What Will Happen</h2>
        <p>In the event that FreeRossDAO wins the auction, the NFT will be fractionalized into $ROSS and distributed pro-rata, weighted by contribution. $ROSS will serve as governance rights within FreeRossDAO and fractional ownership of the “GENESIS COLLECTION” NFT.</p>
        <p>In the specific event that FreeRossDAO wins the auction with a bid less than the contributed ETH, the leftover funds will be held in the treasury, governed by FreeRossDAO and available for future impact.</p>
        <p>In the event that FreeRossDAO loses the auction, contributions will be available for full redemption.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Free Ross DAO Mission</h2>
        <p>Following a successful bid, the DAO will be lead by Trippy, Chief Freeing Officer and collectively use leftover funds raised too continue to pursue efforts to get Ross freed and further the awareness for prison reform.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Governance</h2>
        <p>Once the bid to acquire the Genesis Collection is successful, contributors will be given $ROSS tokens in return for their contributions pro-rata, serving as the governance token in Free Ross DAO. Holders of $ROSS will be able to vote on proposals. If the bid is not successful, the DAO will be dissolved with participants able to redeem their contribution in full.</p>
        <p>Proposals will be created by Trippy and a future DAO council, with the multssigners below acting as the executioners of approved proposals.</p>
